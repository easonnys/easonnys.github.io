          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          I observed that the design of this website was highly 
          distinctive compared to others I have reviewed. The first
          two elements that stood out to me were the color palette,
          which was exceptionally well-executed, and the mouse cursor
          effect. The cursor featured a trailing animation that
          followed its movement, creating the impression that the 
          user was actively drawing on the screen. 
          This design choice enhanced the interactive experience 
          and contributed to the website's uniqueness.

          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time looking through all of his projects, 
          paying attention to how each one was designed to match what 
          the client wanted. Every project had a different style, but 
          I also noticed some similarities. For example, he used some
           of the same fonts in multiple projects, which made his work
            feel connected. His website designs were always
             well-organized and easy to use, making it simple to
              explore his work. The layouts were clean, and the 
              interactive features made the experience smooth and 
              engaging. Everything felt carefully planned to help 
              users focus on the content without feeling lost or 
              distracted.

        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          I spend most of my time scrolling through his website especially 
          in his projects page.I went through clicking in those projects, exploring 
          them. I also scanned through his work by reading and got the gist of what his 
          client had in mind and how he managed to deliver. I observed each of his work
          individually, and it was very professional and minimalistic.

        <h2>
          What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          I would say that the primary goal of his website is to sell
           his skills as a designer. Through the website, he effectively 
           showcases his capabilities by incorporating smooth transitions
            and clean animations that enhance the overall user experience.
             These elements not only make the website visually appealing but
              also highlight his proficiency in creating engaging and dynamic 
              designs. Furthermore, he has strategically implemented a sense 
              of familiarity in his design, which helps strengthen his branding
               and makes the website feel cohesive and consistent. By doing 
               this, he not only demonstrates his technical skills but also
                establishes a clear identity, making it easier for potential
                 clients to recognize and connect with his work.

        <h2>
          How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>This whole interactive experience showcases his skills, animation
          color pallette decision, design, and layout. The smooth transitions and 
          animation throughout the website showcases his ability to create dynamic and
          engaging user experience. These elements are not just visually appealing but also
          serves an important function for his website. Furthermore, the layout and structure
          reflect his attention to detail and understanding of user experience. By maintaining
          a clean and well-organized design, he make sures that users has an easy time 
          navigating his website. This level of simplicity and clarity in the design 
          showcases his expertise in creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces,
           which is key in establishing credibility as a designer. I am also impressed
           by his use of familiarity in his design. Examples including the layout and sometimes
           the consistent fonts. This is a common way to enhance your brand, making 
           potential customers to recognize his work. Though, most of the time it depends 
           on the client's expectation.

          What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted

        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          I spent approximately 10-15 minutes navigating through his 
          website and reviewing all of his projects. The website is
          highly organized and concise, allowing for a thorough 
          exploration within a single session. The content is presented 
          in a manner that is clear and accessible, ensuring that the user 
          is able to easily engage with the information without the need
           for multiple sessions. The design effectively curates the 
           content in a way that guides the user through the material 
           seamlessly. Although, it took me quite awhile to figure it out 
           to scroll to navigate through his website.

          How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be

        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          The interactive experience communicates through it's design and layout.
          It subtly suggests the ideal duration and frequency of interaction by providing clear, 
          intuitive navigation and pacing that doesn’t overwhelm the user.
           For instance, the website’s content is broken down into digestible 
           sections, encouraging users to explore at their own pace. Elements 
           such as smooth transitions and animations gives user a sense of 
           progression. Overall, it is designed to be revisited multiple times
           by different users.

          Visually, the website implements elements commonly seen in games and videos
          such as smooth transitions and motion-graphics. Additionally, the minimalistic
          design takes the inspiration from modern web design, while the use of fonts 
          and layouts hints at traditional print design and graphic design principles

        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          The most frustrating aspect of the experience for me 
          was the frequent lag spikes that occurred while 
          navigating through this website. These interruptions 
          caused delays, forcing me to wait for the website to
           respond. This not only slowed down the 
           overall experience but also disrupted the flow, making
            it feel less smooth and efficient. The lag was 
            particularly noticeable on some pages, which made the
             interaction feel less seamless and more frustrating,
              as I had to repeatedly pause and wait for the website
               to catch up with my actions.

        </h2>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>
          The most satisfying parts are the mouse cursor and the animations, 
          the main reason I chose this because I found the mouse cursor and animation
          are the most unique. The animation when I'm scrolling down manage to
          give an impression of an movie ending credits scene, which gave an cinematic feel. 
          The mouse cursor's trail makes it seem like I was drawing something on his page, although there were frequent
          lag spikes. Despite all it's flaws, I was able to enjoy this experience and 
          possibly take one of these inspirations for my own website in the future.
